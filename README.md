# Data-Cleaning-Proj
This is a simple project that I undertook to hone and showcase my data cleaning skills. <br>
The dataset is an extract of data scientist job postings from Glassdoor <a href = https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/data-science-job-posting-on-glassdoor?select=Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv> Link </a> <br>
I cleaned the data, simplifying and enabling further analysis down the track more easily and accurately. I also engineered some features to enable additional analysis and insights to be discovered from the previously dirty and unorganised dataset.
